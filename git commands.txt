1.) basic setting for a folder
pwd: print working directory ($ pwd)
cd: change directory ($ cd "D:/git check repos")
ls: list of all files in working directory ($ ls)
to clear code mess: ($ clear)

2.) check status & initiate process
Check for a folder to be a repository already ($ git status)
($ git init): inititalize git repository
Look for status now

3.) add files
($ git add .): for all files in working directory
($ git add file_name): for adding one specific file (file_name)
($ git log): to check commit history)
($ git staus): nothing to commit
#### modify one of the files in the working directory
($ git status): will now tell you which file still need to commit
