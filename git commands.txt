1.) basic setting for a folder
pwd: print working directory ($ pwd)
cd: change directory ($ cd "D:/git check repos")
ls: list of all files in working directory ($ ls)
to clear code mess: ($ clear)

2.) check status & initiate process
Check for a folder to be a repository already ($ git status)
($ git init): inititalize git repository
Look for status now

3.) add files
($ git add .): for all files in working directory
($ git add file_name): for adding one specific file (file_name)
($ git log): to check commit history)
($ git staus): nothing to commit
($ git commit -m "1st save"): to save changes
#### modify one of the files in the working directory
($ git status): will now tell you which file still need to commit
($ git add .): for all files in working directory
($ git commit -m "2nd save"): to save changes
($ git staus): nothing to commit; workarea is clean
($ git log): look out for multiple commit we made earlier

Note: If we close gitbash window, no worries it will take from there (check log & status). No need to initialize again

4.) better logging & checkouts: (Super Awesome)
($ git log --graph -- decorate --all --pretty=oneline): log files with ID
($ git checkout ID): will make changes in working dir for that particular ID step

5.) creating & pushing to repository
($ git remote add origin https://github.com/schnkhl/rep_example.git): get repository access
($ git push -u origin master): push files to github

Note: if you make any changes in local dir. it won't reflect on github, untill you add, commit and push it ($ git push origin master)

6.) Pulling from github to local directory
($ git pull)

7) Conflict Resolution:
Problem: If 2 collabrators are working on same file & made changes on same line (e.g. 3rd line), in this scenario github will get confuse which one is the original code line & will through error while merging them
Solution: We have to manually update the lines in merging file & save changes

Example:
Q. What is your name?
A. My name is Sachin.
